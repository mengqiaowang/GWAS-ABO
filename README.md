# GWAS-ABO

This is the deposit of the R binomial and multinomial models for genomewide association study (GWAS) of ABO blood types in a Chinese population.

The accompanied manuscript is now under review and should be available by the end of December 2020.

ABO blood types were measured by agglutination experiments using antisera reagents for blood group antigens. 

# Binomial model
- ABO blood types are treated as a binary trait respectively:
  e.g. A vs. non-A (B, AB, and O combined)

# Multinomial model
- ABO blood types are treated as a quaternary (four-level) trait:
  O, A, B, and AB.


P-value from the null-hypothesis statistical test (NHST) for the coefficient of the independent variable (SNP) ($\beta == 0$) was used to evaluate the genetic association.
