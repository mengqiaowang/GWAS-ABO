# GWAS-ABO

This is the deposit of the R binomial and multinomial models for genomewide association study (GWAS) of ABO blood types in a Chinese population.

The accompanied manuscript is now under review and should be available by the end of December 2020.
<br/><br/><br/>
ABO blood types were measured by agglutination experiments using antisera reagents for blood group antigens. 

***Binomial model***
- ABO blood types are treated as a binary trait respectively:
  e.g. A vs. non-A (B, AB, and O combined)

***Multinomial model***
- ABO blood types are treated as a quaternary (four-level) trait:
  O, A, B, and AB.


P-value from the null-hypothesis statistical test (NHST) for the coefficient of the independent variable (SNP, H0: beta = 0 *vs.* H1: beta != 0) was used to evaluate the genetic association.
